# Graze

_Instagram Clone Mobile App_

I built Graze during a 5-day hackathon at Fullstack Academy. I wanted to learn a new technology while building off of my pre-existing knowledge so I decided to work with React Native (with Expo).

## Tech Stack

I used React Native, Expo, React Navigation, and Firebase for the basis of Graze.

Firebase Authentication, Firestore, and Storage provided an easy way to manage all user data, from login info to user settings and posts.

To build the app without having to write Native code I used Expo, a toolchain built around React Native and helps with developing iOS and Android apps with JavaScript and React.
